### Your next project 

At this point you would have already created one solo project during Module 5 and a few other projects in the other modules. Now is the time to seriously keep coding and embark on your second project. Employers want to see that you can "do the thing." They want to know that you can start with nothing and build your own moderately complex application. Now that you're out of the program, this is the time to experiment with technologies you did not get to look into during Mod 5. These may include:

  * Mongo
  * Node / Express
  * WebSockets
  * D3 / Chart.js
  * Oauth (Log in with Facebook etc)
  * Google Maps etc 
  * React Native
  * Draggable 
  * Draft.js
  * P5.js
  
The goal here is to begin creating a new project that builds on the skills you have already learned and will help you to get even further. You should be working on this daily (or every other day). Draw/sketch out what this app looks like on paper and execute it in code. Can't think of an idea? Make a weather app. Don't like that idea? Build a to-do list. Think of technologies you've always wanted to try and build around those. As you keep coding ideas will come to you â€“ don't use the lack of original ideas as a reason to not code. Once the idea comes, go wild.


## Deploy

After you have completed a project, it is key that you deploy your project so that you can send it to employers. A project should not solely live on your github page. However, this does not mean deploying a half finished product. Ensure that you have fully tested your site before sending to anyone. This does not mean just testing your functionality but also testing for edge cases. For example what what happened if you tried to search in an empty search bar...would your app break?


## Cleanup

Module 5 is probably a blur by now but there's still a need for you to start cleaning up your project. When we say clean up your project we mean several things:

1. Refactor your code to reflect best practices. 
  This means that no new functionality should be added while finding a balance between elegance and efficiency. You will sometimes find yourself obsessing over efficiency/elegance and may not sure how to move forward. This is a good time to ask a friend/instructor to take a look.

2. Write some tests
  Writing tests allows you to add some more polish to your applications. It says to an employer that you have considered the long-term sustainability of your code. 
  
3. Clean up your github page
  When someone goes to your github page for your project they shouldn't be seeing the default Rails/Create React App project guidelines. You should include the following:
    * A description
    * Screenshots and/or demo 
    * Technologies/Frameworks used 
    * How to clone and build
    * Link to the deployed version
  
  
  
### Learn some CSS

Semantic and Bootstrap are great tools for fast prototyping. However, you want to be able to demonstrate your own ability to write CSS to craft a well-developed application. To truly call yourself a fullstack developer you need to not only have backend chops but also some skill at writing your own CSS. This doesn't mean that you must now become a designer yourself but it does mean you should get some practice looking at other designs and improving your own. 


### Computer Science

While you spend your time building your next project, allocate some time to learning about data structures and sorting algorithms (more computer science stuff) as they become crucial when going on certain types of interviews. If you have not had a chance to look at the CS curriculum on Learn, do so now. It will help you start your journey to learning some more CS topics. Actively think about how you might implement some of your learning into your project. Don't let CS be only theoretical, try to make sense of it and make it functional.

This YouTube channel explains CS concepts incredibly well: https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool

Watch these videos and then implement what he's referring to in the video in your own code. Use [repl.it](repl.it) if you don't want to set up your own environment.


### Algorithms

Create an account on **hackerank.com** or **codewars.com** or any other site you prefer.

Begin with the [Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/arrays) section. It's important to stay on top of this. Solve at least one problem a day. Also, in your progression through this material feel free at times to go back and re-implement a problem you solved from a few days prior or a week earlier to stay on top of the material. Don't rush through these problems. If any of these problems brings up a core concept, make an attempt to implement it on a white board or in a Google Doc, challenging yourself to solve it without using auto-complete from the compiler.

When a problem is asked, open repl.it and make an attempt at solving it. These are questions that can and will very well be asked of you on interviews that involve algorithms. 


It is often also helpful to start solving these problems on a piece of paper. It may be hard to remember the syntax but over time it will become second nature. Allow your mind to be the compiler as you work your way through a problem. 


## Keep on learning

The journey of a programmer is one of constant learning. That being said, you need to stay up to date on new technologies/styles/paradigms etc. that may become popular. This requires you to be an active member of the community by reading blogs, following notable people on twitter and reading books and of course more coding

Have fun. Go get it!
